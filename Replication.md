<h1>Gender Profitability Gap</h1>
<p>
Project design: Studying barriers to firm profitability, growth, and entry into new markets has a long history in the economic discipline. The relatively more recent interest in gender inequality has spurred new studies into the determinants of existing gender gaps in firm characteristics and performance. These more recent studies explore potential barriers unique to women-owned enterprises (WOE) mostly using the currently popular methods of randomized evaluation and observational case studies. As this body of evidence on gender gaps rapidly expands, there is an increasing need for a common framework and rigorous “stock taking” of what has already been investigated and where the highest value add would be for any potential new work. Existing academic literature reviews of field-based work on firm barriers focus broadly on entrepreneurial barriers with limited attention to gender. Additionally, the burgeoning body of gender-focused empirical facts lacks the “lay of the land” foundational analysis enjoyed by its gender-neutral counterpart. Forexample, Woodruff and Quinn (2019) is a meta-analysis of experimental work that has limited mention of gender, and Hsieh and Olken (2014) is an analysis of global data that does not mention gender. There is yet to exist a Blau and Kahn (2017) style paper for global gender enterprise gaps and we hope to fill this void.
